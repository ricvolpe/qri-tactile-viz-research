1,178,I found myself breathing with the movements and imagining what the breath patterns would feel like 
2,178,I felt weird
3,180,The visualisation varied throughout the videos and some were a bit intense due to the pace and capcity it covered whilst some felt a bit calm due to the slow relaxed pace of the movement.
4,174,The faster changes in the visualisation made me less comfortable than slow ones.
5,160,"I compared it to breathing. As most of them were fast or short, it made me feel a little jittery."
6,157,"I think the slower and calmer visualizations would feel better, but overall I feel like they all conveyed a positive feeling"
7,165,I visualized it as breathing and tried breathing along. It was very unpleasant.
8,161,I feel like some of them were much of the same
9,170,"it made me feel vary focused as if my own breathing was replaying the videos, it reminded me of asmr "
10,185,I felt relaxed and this feeling was very good for me 
11,171,I tried to think what the visitation would feel like 
12,180,Mos of them made me feel anxious and I associated very intense feelings with most of them
13,182,I mostly used breathing to simulate the visuals and it felt weird and put me in a trance a little bit.
14,163,I was breathing along with it to see how effortful each felt but I couldn't distinguish big differences between a lot of them to be honest
15,158,"What I mostly noticed was how the slower movements created a more relaxed feeling and the faster ones gave a sort of discomfort, some more than others. "
16,179,"All was same, only diference is time"
17,167,"As I viewed the videos and tried to feel what they were showing, I was filled with a warm feeling of peace and tranquility."
18,173,"I looked at the videos and tested the breaths at the same time to see what it felt like. For the most part, I didn't feel stimulated but rather relaxed, the repetition of the video is also something that leaves it unstimulated. Some I found much more complex, but within the standard."

20,167,I felt stress when I wathed.
21,159,the video was identical throughout and i did not feel any difference or change in feelings.
22,168,i felt tight in my chest
23,165,I saw myself accompanying the visualization with my breathing
24,160,"It was unexpected, but highly interesting!"
25,1.2,Nothing much
26,175,"I guess visualizations depict a map  between feeling and heart rate. some are little intense depends how it fades and how the rhythmic is. maybe between resting and running or sick and healthy. in my subconscious, I would imagine myself in those state.   "
27,165,The difference wanted too much focus
28,166,Mostly I felt relaxed throughout the study watching the videos.
29,170,"i found two problems while answering, first, my ratings were based more in my previous calification rather than the image itself, because at first i didnt had a reference, also, i think that the relief or anxiety induced by the image was more the acomulation of feeleings rather than the image itself "
