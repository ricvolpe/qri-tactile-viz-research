## About The Project

This repository contains the data and the analysis code for research carried out by the Qualia Research Institute (QRI) on measuring the effect on survey respondents of visualizations of bodily sensations.

## Data
The [`data`](data) folder contains the output data for all the three experiments we conducted. More information about each experiment and the data fields can be found in the associated [data README file](data/README.md)

## Code
The [analysis](analysis) folders contains the Python code that can be used to reproduce our analysis of the data. Required packages to run the code are referenced in the folder. The folder also contains the figures that our analysis generated and we used in our write-up.
